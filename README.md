# Secondary Mushroom Dataset on Python

In this project, we focused on addressing two key objectives:
1. Predicting mushroom edibility: We used a Random Forest classifier to determine whether a given mushroom was edible or not.
2. Classifying mushroom species: We explored how many groups the mushroom species could be categorized into by applying K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The dataset was loaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset. It is defined by 61069 instances and 20 features and includes 61069 hypothetical mushrooms with caps based on 173 species (353 mushrooms per species). Each mushroom is identified as edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended (the latter class was combined with the poisonous class).
This dataset was inspired by the Mushroom Data Set of J. Schlimmer: url:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom.

The project code was developed in Python.
